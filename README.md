Currently in work:
* A prototype of a case made of small parts, which allows it to be printed on any 3D printer
* Switch selection. Current prototype uses a standard MX switch, but it makes the keyboard's height too high.

Plans for future:
* Custom PCB design powered by KiCad
* Both handwired and pcb versions
* Both one-piece and partial elements designs
