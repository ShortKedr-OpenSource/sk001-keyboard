# sk001-keyboard
Custom handwired 84 key keyboard powered by qmk-firmware and 3d printer

Key Layout:  
![Layout](/sk001-keyboard-layout.png)

Currently in work:
* A prototype of a case made of small parts, which allows it to be printed on any 3D printer
* Switch selection. Current prototype uses a standard MX switch, but it makes the keyboard's height too high.

Plans for future:
* Custom PCB design powered by KiCad
* Both handwired and pcb versions
* Both one-piece and partial elements designs
